<p><strong>Whats New!</strong></p>
<p>- Automatically select page for currently installed Delphi version (this feature was present in previous versions but disappeared in v1.80 by mistake).</p>
<p>- Undo button in packages and experts manager allows to discard changes in case that you messed up your selections.</p>
<p>- "Run Delphi 2010" button between "Start Weareg2" and "Stop Weareg2". This makes it easier to call the three of them in a row, since Weareg2 doesn't need to be active after D2010 has started. The "Run Delphi 2010" button saves any pending changes automatically.</p>
<p>Compiled in Delphi 2009 to reduce the size of the executable.</p>
