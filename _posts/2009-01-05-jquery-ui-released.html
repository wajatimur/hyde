<p>John Resig has announce the release of a brand new JS library: jQuery UI 1.0.</p>
<p>jQuery UI is a set of themable widgets and interactions, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library, that you can use to build highly interactive web applications. The core of the library revolves around different mouse interactions, namely drag and dropping, sorting, selecting, and resizing.</p>
<p>jQuery UI signals the start of a whole new branch of the jQuery project which will focus on developing high-quality, reusable, components that you’ll be able to drop in your applications. Frequently, these components are coming directly to you from traditional jQuery plugins, but with strict coding, documentation, themeing, and demo standards. We hope you’ll enjoy this new level of quality as much as we do.</p>
<p>On top of the core interactions are built a number of reusable widgets, including accordions, date pickers, dialogues, sliders, table sorters, and tabs. Finally, the library is finished off with a few effects that you can use to liven up your site, specifically magnifier and shadow.</p>
