<p><strong>SharpE</strong> is an open source shell replacement for Microsoft Windows 2000 and up, released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
<p>SharpE is now known as <strong>SharpEnviro</strong> starting from 2008. Currently designed to compile on Borland Delphi 2005, and targets Windows 2000 or higher. It makes heavy use of the JCL, JVCL, and Graphics32 libraries for Delphi.</p>
<p>SharpE also allows for the continued use of programs that were once used by native Windows Explorer. This means "My Computer" and other Windows shortcuts are still visible within the shell. This parsing of the data helps stop Explorer from opening when windows starts up.</p>
