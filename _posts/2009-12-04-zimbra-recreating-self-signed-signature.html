<html><body><p>This article contains information for both ZCS 4.5.x and 5.0.x. Please read all instructions with particular attention to version specific sections and notes before attempting to recreate a self-signed SSL certificate. If you are using ZCS 5.0, it is recommended that you first try using the Administration Console Certificates tool, discussed further in the Administration_Console_and_CLI_Certificate_Tools Article. This tool simplifies and speeds the process of recreating a self-signed SSL certificate.
