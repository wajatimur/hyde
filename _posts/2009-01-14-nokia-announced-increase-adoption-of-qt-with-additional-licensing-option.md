Today Nokia announced that their Qt cross-platform User Interface (UI) and applications framework would be available under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 license from the release of Qt 4.5 that is scheduled for March 2009. In addition, Qt will now be available from a new source over at qtsoftware.com.

This move to LGPL licensing will provide open source developers with more permissive licensing than GPL and also increase flexibility for the developers. The Qt source code repositories will be made publicly available and will encourage contributions not only from desktop but also embedded developer communities. These changes are meant to drive developers to evolve the Qt framework.
