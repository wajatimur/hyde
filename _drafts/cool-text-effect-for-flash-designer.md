TxEff2 is a Flash CS3/CS4 component (by JumpeyeComponents) created for easing the text animation process. TxEff2 is also a framework based on patterns, a large collection of classes, which enable cool show/hide and swap transitions on texts. The main advantages of using the FlashEff engine, FlashEff panel and working with FlashEff patterns are compatibility, performance and high quality at a great price. Also, you can use FlashEff gallery to browse, save and find presets as well as FlashEff forum to find related issues.

### TxEff2 features

- New architecture (based on FlashEff)
- Improved performance (thanks to TweenLite)
- Lower file-size
- Seamless pattern import
- More patterns (80+)
- Filters (like reflection, glows, stripes)
- Compatible with FlashEff effects and patterns
- Cool new visual User Interface
- Swap through different texts (not only show & hide)
