<p>Version 1.3 of Docker have introduced a long awaited feature which is <code>docker exec</code> that allowed user to interact with the process inside the container.</p>
<pre class="source-code">docker exec my-lamp cat /var/log/messages</pre>
<p>User not only can peek inside the container but actually can enter into container without having additional setup such as <code>nsenter</code> or others. By spawning a <code>bash</code> program and stream back terminal to client.</p>
<pre class="source-code">docker exec -it my-lamp /bin/bash</pre>
<p>The flag <code>-i</code> will keep the STDIN open thus allowing Bash program to read an input from client.</p>
