<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_484311">The typical way to make existing cars lighter would be the use of hi-tech materials, lots of electronics and even hybrid drives.
</p>
<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_484314">Let´s build a new car, instead!</h2>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_484317">The heart and secret of the Loremo is its patented steel structure. It is lightweight and composed of very few elements that are arranged to ensure maximum passenger protection - much like a formula 1 racing car in which pilots have survived crashes at 150 mph unscathed.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_484320">The seating arrangement and the doors are a direct consequence of that and a prerequisite for the economy of the car. You need to crack eggs to make an omelette.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_484323">Adding an efficient outer shell to it, we found that a lighweight engine with very moderate power could speed it up to 100 mph and push the Loremo´s (US-)gallon mileage beyond 120.</p>
