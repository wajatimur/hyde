<p>What your noticing is that the single domain specified in zimbraDefaultDomainName doesn't need to type @domain.com for login.
If you have two domains what you can do is set a virtual host so by visiting mail.domainB.com they'd just type the username part.
Quote:
zmprov md domainB.com zimbraVirtualHostname mail.domainB.com
(Where mail.domainB.com points to 2nd.server.name.com when resolved via DNS both internally and externally.)</p>
<p>Also, the server uses zimbraPublicServiceHostname to generate REST URLs, ie: briefcase, document, calendar sharing etc.</p>
<p>Say it's generating URL's like http:// 2nd.server.name.com and you'd rather have it http:// mail.domainB.com:
Quote:
zmprov md domainB.com zimbraPublicServiceHostname mail.domainB.com
In 5.0.9+ REST URL's can now be composed of 3 attributes: zimbraPublicService[Protocol + Hostname + Port] to avoid dependency on zimbraServer objects.</p>
