<p>TxEff2 is a Flash CS3/CS4 component (by JumpeyeComponents) created for easing the text animation process. TxEff2 is also a framework based on patterns, a large collection of classes, which enable cool show/hide and swap transitions on texts. The main advantages of using the FlashEff engine, FlashEff panel and working with FlashEff patterns are compatibility, performance and high quality at a great price. Also, you can use FlashEff gallery to browse, save and find presets as well as FlashEff forum to find related issues.</p>
