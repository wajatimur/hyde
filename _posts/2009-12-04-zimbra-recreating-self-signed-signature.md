This article contains information for both ZCS 4.5.x and 5.0.x. Please read all instructions with particular attention to version specific sections and notes before attempting to recreate a self-signed SSL certificate. If you are using ZCS 5.0, it is recommended that you first try using the Administration Console Certificates tool, discussed further in the Administration\_Console\_and\_CLI\_Certificate\_Tools Article. This tool simplifies and speeds the process of recreating a self-signed SSL certificate. http://wiki.zimbra.com/index.php?title=SSL\_Certificate\_Problems
