The latest delphi update 3 introduced a new method of anti-piracy which isthe digitally signed binaries, The most important one is sanctuarylib.dll, which is responsible for validating registration slip files. All of you who had problems after update 3 must have been using cracked sanctuarylib.dll, The update 3 doesn't alter or update this dll, but, as said, bds.exe checks for a digital signature for this dll, if not found then raise AV. Those who did not used a cracked sanctuarylib.dll + slip files must have updated succsefully, that is, anyone who used just a keygen + Distiller had no problems applying update 3. So you need an original digitally signed and latest version of sanctuarylib.dll, Distiller and a keygen (only required when installing delphi),

Assuming you already have delphi with update 3+4 already installed do this:

- Copy sanctuarylib.dll to bin dir replacing exsiting one - Use Delphi Distiller as usual, you know, the secret stuff! - Thats all

The joke here is you have to replace a cracked dll with a legit one in order to run delphi, Unlike what you have used to do replacing original binaries with cracked ones

This worked for me with no uninstall/reinstall anyhting, just applied update 3 and got the AV, i followed the steps above and everything worked fine, i even didn't have to use distiller to turn on/off license check, I just replaced the dll and i'm up and running in less than a minute.
