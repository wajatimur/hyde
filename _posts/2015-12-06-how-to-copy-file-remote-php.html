<p>PHP copy function is capable of accepting URL as the source &amp; destination parameters. We can download any file available on the remote host through HTTP connection and copy it to local storage or another remote host.</p>
<p>Destination file will be overwritten if it already exist and if the destination is URL and it's not support the write operation it will fail as well.</p>
<pre class="source-code">$source = 'http://example.com/robots.txt';
$destination = 'robots.txt';

if (copy($source, $destination)) {
    echo "Successfully copy $file to local server.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to copy $file !";
}</pre>
