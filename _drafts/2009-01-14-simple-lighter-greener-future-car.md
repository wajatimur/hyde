## The other way round

The typical way to make existing cars lighter would be the use of hi-tech materials, lots of electronics and even hybrid drives.

## Let´s build a new car, instead!

The heart and secret of the Loremo is its patented steel structure. It is lightweight and composed of very few elements that are arranged to ensure maximum passenger protection - much like a formula 1 racing car in which pilots have survived crashes at 150 mph unscathed.

The seating arrangement and the doors are a direct consequence of that and a prerequisite for the economy of the car.&nbsp;You need to crack eggs to make an omelette.

Adding an efficient outer shell to it, we found that a lighweight engine with very moderate power could speed it up to 100 mph and push the Loremo´s (US-)gallon mileage beyond 120.
