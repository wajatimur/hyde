In the current state of software development, with projects becoming more and more complex, building, testing and releasing of software projects consumes an ever-increasing amount of time and resources. Automated Build Studio is a powerful build and release management system that provides an easy way to automate the software development build, test and release processes. Its intuitive interface and unprecedented flexibility allows even inexperienced users to create complex visual macros which can automate repetitive or day-to-day tasks with the single click of a button.  Macro runs can be scheduled for automatic execution with the built-in Task Scheduler. This makes Automated Build Studio the ultimate solution to create reliable automatic daily builds of your software. Automated Build Studio lets you automate each step of the build process: from retrieving files from a version control system, to building installation packages, running automated tests and deploying the latest release of your software projects.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1457242119610_333106">Automated Build Studio is tightly integrated with other AutomatedQA products - AQtime, TestComplete and AQdevTeam. This allows you to not only automate your builds, but in fact automate the entire quality assurance and release processes adopted by your organization. Automation of builds, test runs, memory leak and performance bottleneck searches, creation of bug reports, and finally, releases and deployment can all be accomplished using <a href="http://www.automatedqa.com/products/abs/index.asp" target="_blank">Automated Build Studio</a>.</p>
