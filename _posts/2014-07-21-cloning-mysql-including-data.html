<p>Sometime we might required to create a clone of existing MySQL table for maintenance purpose or testing an experimental query. We only need 2 query to do this.</p>
<pre class="source-code">CREATE TABLE user_clone LIKE user;
INSERT user_clone SELECT * FROM user;</pre>
<p>The first line will create a clone of source table including its index and the second line will copy all data from existing one.</p>
</body></html>
