<p>A compilation of open-source and totally free Delphi component to access MySql database. All component are native and not needed extra driver or add-ins such as BDE or ODBC to run. Compare to VB or Visual C++, Delphi are still lack of database components available in the market.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://zeoslib.sourceforge.net/">1. Zeos Library</a> Components for fast access to MySql, PostgreSql, MicrosoftSQL, Oracle and Interbase SQL servers without use add-ons, such as BDE / ODBC / ADO. Besides, the components - sources of data are compatible with standard TDataset and have a number of additional features. Open Source.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.productivity.org/projects/tmysql/">2. TmySql</a> TmySQL provides access to MySQL servers from Delphi via a visual component and an extendable non-visual component. TmySQL utilizes a single client DLL, which is provided by most Windows-compiled versions of MySQL. TmySQL does not use the database aware components in Delphi, such as TDatabase, TQuery, etc. Open Source.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://directsql.sourceforge.net/">3. DirectSQL</a> The main idea of the project is to have cross-platform (Windows+Linux) delphi native components for directly accesing SQL servers (without using any externall dll's). The first releas will be for My-sql and Interbase, but there are plans to be extendend. GNU General Public License.</p>
