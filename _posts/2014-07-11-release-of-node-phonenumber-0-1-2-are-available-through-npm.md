Release 0.1.2 have been available by today (11 July 2014) through&nbsp;[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-phonenumber) or you can clone from my [GitHub](https://github.com/wajatimur/node-phonenumber) repository.

Basically nothing was change on the base-code, the true purpose of this release is to add the Apache 2.0 License attribute to the&nbsp;[readme](https://github.com/wajatimur/node-phonenumber/blob/master/README.md) file to reflect the original&nbsp;[libphonenumber](https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/) licensing attribute.

Thanks to Lion Vollnhals on making remark on this issue.
