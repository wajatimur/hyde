 **Whats New!**

- Automatically select page for currently installed Delphi version (this feature was present in previous versions but disappeared in v1.80 by mistake).

- Undo button in packages and experts manager allows to discard changes in case that you messed up your selections.

- "Run Delphi 2010" button between "Start Weareg2" and "Stop Weareg2". This makes it easier to call the three of them in a row, since Weareg2 doesn't need to be active after D2010 has started. The "Run Delphi 2010" button saves any pending changes automatically.

Compiled in Delphi 2009 to reduce the size of the executable.
