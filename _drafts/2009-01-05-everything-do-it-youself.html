Covering the spectrum of DIY, the blog provides a steady stream of DIY projects, how-to's, ideas, tips, reviews, even safety recalls. Topical areas include home improvement, hobbies and crafts, technology projects, and home and family ideas and tips.
DIY Life is running a contest too, over 30 days we'll be giving away over $4,000 in prizes. That's a new prize, a new tool, every single day for 30 days. Check out the DIY Life Toolstravaganza contest page for more info.</p>
